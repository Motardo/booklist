Returning after her father's death to her hometown of Lake Eden, Minn., Hannah opens her own shop, the Cookie Jar, where much of the town's gossip percolates along with the strong coffee. Early one morning, she finds the driver of a delivery truck shot dead in the alley behind her shop. Hannah's brother-in-law, Bill, the county's deputy sheriff, recruits her to help him chase down the culprit. A surprising number of suspects emerges, but due to her cafe business and catering of local social events, Hannah is admirably placed to hear all, see much and investigate a little. Motives ranging from blackmail to extortion abound, as do descriptions of clothing and shopping. Cat fanciers will appreciate knowing how Hannah found her cat, but separating the wheat of the significant from the chaff of the irrelevant can be challenging. Fluke also stretches the imagination when Bill leaves most of the sleuthing to Hannah and when the sheriff's men fail to discover a second body at the dairy where the first victim was employed.

This unlikely cast inhabits a narrative spanning 30 years. Some, like Soleil Marie, a sugarcane laborer, or Inez, who can't avoid seeing the future, speak with startling vividness. Others, like the child Luella, are less convincing. All are trapped behind the sweetly poisoned bars of the 'sugar cage'--a 'sign' in the dregs of one character's glass. Inez spots it: 'bars glistening like white sand,' a sure sign 'she was going to let love eat her up.' Runaway emotions devour some, others struggle to both love and survive.

Their first child, a boy they name Paul, is born a visibly perfect child, but it then becomes apparent that Norah is giving birth to twins. When the second baby, a girl, is born, David notices immediately she has Down Syndrome. David, recalling the possibility of heart complications and early death, and thinking of his younger sister, June, who died at the age of twelve due to being born with a heart defect, decides that the baby girl will be placed in an institution to spare Norah the great grief and suffering June's premature death had caused his own mother. Caroline, the nurse—who has been romantically in love with David since the moment she met him—is charged with the task of carrying the infant to the institution. After assessing the wretched conditions of the place, however, she decides to keep and raise the baby herself. Remembering Norah's mention of the names she had chosen for her baby, both for a boy and a girl, Caroline names the baby Phoebe. While Caroline is at the store buying baby supplies, her car battery dies and she is stranded in the snow with Phoebe. She is picked up by a truck driver, Albert 'Al' Simpson, who lets her shelter with Phoebe in his truck before driving them to Caroline's home in Lexington, and eventually staying there for the night. Meanwhile, David lies to Norah and tells her that their daughter died at birth. This leaves his passive wife plagued by post-natal depression, as those around her refuse to let her talk about the daughter she lost, treating her as if she should be satisfied with Paul and forget about Phoebe's 'death'. She decides to hold a memorial for Phoebe and places an announcement in the paper without David's knowledge—astonished, Caroline seeks David out after reading it, and, after hearing that she had kept the baby rather than take her to the institution, he bids her to do what she thinks is right.

Rather than be consumed by sadness, she has built a life around the faded plantation where her remote father and hunting-obsessed brothers raise the legendary Lowcountry Boykin hunting spaniels. It is a meager, narrow, masculine world, but to Emily it has magic: the storied deep-sea dolphins who come regularly to play in Sweetwater Creek; her extraordinary bond with the beautiful dogs she trains; her almost mystic communion with her own spaniel, Elvis; the dreaming old Lowcountry itself. Emily hides from the dreaded world here. It is enough.

Agreement 3 Don’t make assumptions - Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. Agreement 4 Always do your best - Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret. ideas come from the ancient Toltec wisdom of the native people of Southern Mexico.

  { title: "N is for noose", read_date: "2013-08-24", author_id: "36", description: "The fourteenth of the alphabet novels takes place mainly in the small-town mountain community of Nota Lake, California (population 2,356, elevation 4,312) where Kinsey has inherited a client called Selma Newquist from her periodic boyfriend Robert Dietz, temporarily out of action back home in Carson City, where Kinsey has reluctantly been taking care of him following knee surgery. Through much of the novel there is an oppressive feeling of both physical and metaphorical cold as Kinsey tries to cope with being out of her Santa Teresa comfort zone. Selma's brief is vague: she fears her husband Tom, a sheriff's officer who died of a heart attack a few weeks before, had something on his mind at the time of his death, and she wants Kinsey to find out what it was. With very little to go on, Kinsey needs all the help she can get, but it is not forthcoming from the residents of the insular community, where she finds Tom was held in high respect, whilst reactions to Selma range from tolerance for Tom's sake to downright dislike. Tom's colleagues in the sheriff's department, including Tom's partner Rafer LaMott and brother Macon Newquist, close ranks around his memory, though their respective wives, as well as Selma's 25-year-old hunk of a son by her first marriage, Brant, are slightly more friendly and helpful, as is CHP officer James Tennyson, who found Tom's body. A frustrating search of Tom's home office reveals nothing more than some doodling and a list of phone numbers, but it seems someone is worried about what Kinsey might find when she is first threatened by a masked driver, and then attacked in her temporary accommodation, the dismally unwelcoming Nota Lake Cabins run by Tom's elder sister Cecilia Boden. Retreating to Santa Teresa to almost literally lick her wounds (two dislocated fingers and a beaten-up jaw), Kinsey follows up leads from the phone numbers she found in Tom's office, from which she finds Tom was interested in the case of a petty criminal, Alfie Toth, whom he had traced to a hotel in Santa Teresa before Toth died in what might have been a murder or a bizarre suicide. Toth's unusual death has curious similarities to that of a prison associate of his, career-criminal, child-abuser and rapist Pinkie Ritter, who died 5 years earlier but whose body only came to light near Nota Lake shortly before Toth was killed. Following up more of Tom's recent phone calls, Kinsey traces local sheriff's department officer Colleen Sellers, who had been in love with Tom, who reluctantly assists with information that Tom was suspicious that someone close to him was responsible for the deaths of both Toth and Ritter. When she also finds out that one of Ritter's daughters, Margaret, worked for Tom at the sheriff's department, Kinsey reluctantly realises she has to return to Nota Lake to wrap up the case. Now enduring open hostility in the town and a sinister atmosphere of danger and unsure who she can trust, Kinsey discovers that Rafer's daughter Barrett has had Tom's missing field notes since his death - but they are in code. Belatedly, Kinsey cracks the code and realises that the threat comes not from one of Tom's colleagues, but his step-son, Brant, who had himself been sexually abused by Ritter, killed him in retaliation and then killed witness Toth later when he found out through Tom's investigation where Toth was. It was the realisation that Brant had committed murder, and that Brant had found Toth through him, which was causing Tom's anguish before his death. Despite being unwittingly drugged by Brant in a final showdown, Kinsey manages to subdue him, much to Selma's horror." },
